    "q": "My video is too dark / blurry / unstable ‚Äî will it still count?",

  },
  "q12": {
    "q": "Can I have music playing in the background?",
    "a": "Yes, as long as it doesn't interfere with visibility or audio review. Just avoid anything offensive or distracting, this is still a community event!"
  },
  "q13": {
    "q": "How do you check for AI-generated or looped videos?",
